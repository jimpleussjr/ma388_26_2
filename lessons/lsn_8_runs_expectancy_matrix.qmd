## Review

Last lesson, we discussed the following three models:

\begin{align}
Wpct &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 RD + \epsilon \\
Wpct &= \frac{R^2}{R^2 + RA^2} + \epsilon \\
Wpct &= \frac{R^k}{R^k + RA^k} + \epsilon
\end{align}

-   Determine the value of $k$ in the third model for the 2018 season.

-   Calculate the predicted wins for each team in 2018 and plot the residuals vs. the predicted values.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 2.5, fig.cap = "Pythagorean predictions, k = 1.75 (2018)"}
teams2018 <- Teams |> 
  filter(yearID == 2018) |> 
  mutate(Wpct = W/(W+L),
         logWL = log(W/L),
         logRRA = log(R/RA))

k <- teams2018 |> 
  lm(logWL ~ 0 + logRRA, data = _) |> 
  tidy() |> 
  pull(estimate)

teams2018 <- teams2018 |> 
  mutate(.fitted = R^k/(R^k + RA^k),
         .resid = Wpct - .fitted)

teams2018 |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid, label = teamID)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel() +
  labs(x = "Predicted Win Percentage",
       y = "Residuals")
```

## Value of Plays

Using the 10-runs-per-win rule of thumb (or more precise estimates using the other models), we now have a nice way of converting runs to wins. This leads to our next obvious question -- how do we score runs? Simply put, players make plays, and sometimes those plays lead to runs. It's time to assess how many runs players and plays are worth.

### Run Expectancy Matrix

\* The first step is to calculate the *run expectancy matrix*. The run expectancy matrix tells us the average number of runs scored in the remainder of an inning for each state (runner/out combination) of an inning.

The state of the game consists of four digits. The first three digits indicate the location of runners on base. The last digit indicates the number of outs.

Examples:

-   "000 0" - no runners on base; no outs

-   "111 2" - bases loaded; two outs

-   "010 1" - runner on second base; one out

*How do we interpret the values in the matrix?*

\vspace{1in}

*Do you see any trends over time?*

\vspace{1in}We are looking at run expectancy matrices. There is another type of matrix called a [run probability matrix](http://tangotiger.net/re24.html). *Explain how they differ.*

### Run Expectancy Matrix from Retrosheet Data

Typically, we use Retrosheet play-by-play data to calculate the run expectancy matrix. Below, we will calculate it for 2011 using the code from our textbook.

```{r, cache = TRUE}
# Import Retrosheet play-by-play data from our textbook site.

site = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxtoki/baseball_R/"
fields <- read_csv(file = paste(site, "master/data/fields.csv", sep =""))
retro2011 <- read_csv(file = paste(site, "master/data/all2011.csv", sep = ""),
                    col_names = pull(fields, Header),
                    na = character())
colnames(retro2011) <- tolower(colnames(retro2011))
```

This data frame contains one line for every play in the 2011 season. There are approximately 200,000 lines in this data set.

```{r}
retro2011 |> 
  select(game_id, away_team_id, inn_ct, outs_ct,
         bat_id, pit_id, event_cd) |> 
  head(10) |> 
  kable()
```

To understand what happened in this game, we'll need to know what all the [event codes](https://www.retrosheet.org/eventfile.htm%5D) are for various baseball outcomes described by the `event_cd` field.

![Event codes](eventcodes.png){width="50%"}

If we further consider the `event_tx` and `pitch_seq_tx` fields, we can more comprehensively reconstruct each at-bat. Let's try to describe what happened in the first inning of this game. We'll need to know the [position numbers](https://baseballtrainingworld.com/what-do-the-numbers-mean-in-a-double-play-with-examples/) to interpret the event text strings.

retro2011 |> 
  select(inn_ct, outs_ct,
         bat_id, pit_id, pitch_seq_tx, event_tx) |>

  kable()
```

### Calculate the Run Expectancy Matrix

The textbook provides the code below to generate the run expectancy matrix.

```{r}
retro2011 <- retro2011 |> 
  mutate(runs_before = away_score_ct + home_score_ct,
         half_inning = paste(game_id, inn_ct, bat_home_id),
         runs_scored = 
           (bat_dest_id > 3) + (run1_dest_id > 3) + 
           (run2_dest_id > 3) + (run3_dest_id > 3))

half_innings <- retro2011 |>
  group_by(half_inning) |>
  summarize(outs_inning = sum(event_outs_ct),
            runs_inning = sum(runs_scored),
            runs_start = first(runs_before),
            max_runs = runs_inning + runs_start)

retro2011 <- retro2011 |>
  inner_join(half_innings, by = "half_inning") |>
  mutate(runs_roi = max_runs - runs_before)

retro2011 <- retro2011 |>
  mutate(bases = 
           paste(ifelse(base1_run_id > '',1,0),
                 ifelse(base2_run_id > '',1,0),
                 ifelse(base3_run_id > '',1,0), sep = ""),
         state = paste(bases, outs_ct))

retro2011 <- retro2011 |>
  mutate(is_runner1 =
           as.numeric(run1_dest_id==1 | bat_dest_id == 1),
         is_runner2 = 
           as.numeric(run1_dest_id == 2 | run2_dest_id == 2 |
                        bat_dest_id == 2),
         is_runner3 = 
           as.numeric(run1_dest_id == 3 | run2_dest_id == 3 |
                        run3_dest_id == 3 | bat_dest_id == 3),
         new_outs = outs_ct + event_outs_ct,
         new_bases = paste(is_runner1,is_runner2, is_runner3, sep = ""),
         new_state = paste(new_bases, new_outs))
```

\newpage

```{r}
retro2011 <- retro2011 |>
  filter((state != new_state) | (runs_scored > 0))

retro2011_complete <- retro2011 |>
  filter(outs_inning == 3)

erm_2011 <- retro2011_complete |>
  group_by(bases, outs_ct) |> # same as grouping by state
  summarize(mean_run_value = mean(runs_roi))

erm_2011_wide <- erm_2011 |> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = outs_ct, 
    values_from = mean_run_value, 
    names_prefix = "Outs="
  )

write_csv(erm_2011_wide, "erm_2011_wide.csv")

erm_2011_wide |> kable()
```

Now we use this expected run table to determine the value of every event.

```{r}
retro2011 <- retro2011 |> 
  left_join(erm_2011, join_by("bases", "outs_ct")) |> 
  rename(rv_start = mean_run_value) |> 
  left_join(
    erm_2011, 
    join_by(new_bases == bases, new_outs == outs_ct)
  ) |> 
  rename(rv_end = mean_run_value) |> 
  replace_na(list(rv_end = 0)) |> 
  mutate(run_value = rv_end - rv_start + runs_scored)
```

Note the code above also adds some very useful columns to the play-by-play data related to the state and run expectancy at the start and end of each play.

```{r}
retro2011 |> 
 select(bat_id, event_cd, state, rv_start,
        new_state, rv_end, runs_scored, run_value) |>
  head(10) |> 
  kable(digits = 3)
```
