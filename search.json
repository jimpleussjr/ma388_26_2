    "text": "Introduction\nAt the end of 2001, the Oakland Athletics were losing three star players (Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi, and Jason Isringhausen) to free agency. Their general manager, Billy Beane, had a limited budget to work with as he looked for their replacements. He wanted to find players who were effective at producing runs but were undervalued in the market. At the time, teams used mostly traditional statistics like batting average (BA), home runs (HR), and runs batted in (RBI) to value players. However, evidence from sabermetrics suggested there were better statistics for determining players’ contributions to run scoring. The book Moneyball by Michael Lewis and the film by the same name follow the 2002 Oakland A’s.\nPut yourself in the position of Billy Beane. How would you approach this problem?"

    "text": "How many wins to make the playoffs?\nLet’s see historically how many wins it takes to make the playoffs. Below, we will look at the five seasons (1997-2001) preceding the 2002 season. First, we need to add a variable playoff to the Teams table, which is an indicator of whether the team made the playoffs (1) or did not make the playoffs (2).\n\n# Get teams in the 1997-2001 seasons.\nmy_teams &lt;- Teams |&gt; \n  filter(yearID &gt;= 1997, yearID &lt;= 2001)\n\n# Obtain a list of teams who made the playoffs by year.\nplayoff_teams &lt;- SeriesPost |&gt; \n  filter(yearID &gt;= 1997, yearID &lt;= 2001) |&gt;\n  select(yearID, teamIDwinner, teamIDloser) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(-yearID, \n               names_to = \"result\",\n               values_to = \"teamID\") |&gt; \n  select(-result) |&gt; \n  distinct() |&gt; \n  mutate(playoffs = \"yes\")\n\n# Add playoff information to my teams.\nmy_teams = my_teams |&gt; \n  left_join(playoff_teams, by = c(\"yearID\", \"teamID\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(playoffs = replace_na(playoffs, \"no\")) \n\n# Let's check whether we did this correctly.  \n# There should be eight playoff teams each year.\nmy_teams |&gt;\n  count(yearID, playoffs)\n\n   yearID playoffs  n\n1    1997       no 20\n2    1997      yes  8\n3    1998       no 22\n4    1998      yes  8\n5    1999       no 22\n6    1999      yes  8\n7    2000       no 22\n8    2000      yes  8\n9    2001       no 22\n10   2001      yes  8\n\n\nNext, let’s look at the data.\n\nmy_teams |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = W, y = R, color = factor(playoffs))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Wins\", \n       y = \"Runs Scored\", \n       color = \"Made Playoffs\",\n       title = \"Wins and Making the Playoffs\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data = filter(my_teams, teamID == \"OAK\"),\n                  aes(x = W, y = R, label = paste(teamID,yearID)),\n                  show.legend = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the figure above, if you were Billy Beane, how many wins should you shoot for in order to have a good chance of making the playoffs?\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides visual inspection, list methods you could use to assess whether a team will make the playoffs based on number of wins."
